         <div class="Sidebars"><h2> Blacksmithing Tools </h2><p> "Unlike many other craftsmen, blacksmiths are able to make most of their own tools. The principal tools are hand hammers and sledgehammers, a great number and variety of chisels, punches and drifts and a selection of tongs with bits or jaws of various shapes. Tools that fit into the tool hole of the anvil, usually with their counterpart top tools fitted with a suitable handle, are required for shaping and cutting.For measuring and marking off, callipers, dividers, a set square and a rule are needed. The callipers, dividers and set square should be heavy and robust enough to withstand use on hot metal under adverse conditions. A brass rule about 600 mm in length is recommended as steel rules rapidly rust when subjected to heat and water." </p>

             <div class="Sidebars Rightsidebar"><h2> Hammers </h2><p> "For everyday work most blacksmiths use a ball-peen hand hammer weighing about 750 to 1 250 g (Fig. 9). A hand hammer should be of a weight that suits the smith. It should have a longer shaft than is usual for other work and be well-balanced. Often special hammers are used for particular jobs. These the smith usually makes as the need arises. Old car-axle shafts are suitable material for hammers. Sledgehammers may be double-faced, straight- or cross-peen, and usually weigh from 3 to 5 kg (Fig. 10). They have long shafts for use with two hands. All hammer heads must be firmly fastened to their shafts. Both wooden and metal wedges are used (Fig. 11). The centre lines of the hammer head and its shaft must be at right angles to each other. Hammer faces should be polished and kept free of marks." </p>

        <div class="container4">
          <div class="Rightbox"><h2> Chisels </h2><p> "The blacksmith needs chisels for cutting both cold and hot metal. For cutting cold metal chisels are comparatively short and thick, while for hot metal they are thinner and longer (Fig. 12A). Chisels can be of many shapes and sizes, special ones often being made to facilitate the work in hand. They are best made from steel containing about 0.8 percent of carbon. Motor-vehicle coil and leaf springs are a fair substitute if nothing else is available." </p>
